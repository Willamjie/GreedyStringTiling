This is a portable eclipse project, works with Java 7 & above. 

Implementation based on the papers "String Similarity via Greedy String Tiling 
and Running Karp-Rabin Matching"
http://www.pam1.bcs.uwa.edu.au/~michaelw/ftp/doc/RKR_GST.ps and "YAP3:Improved 
Detection of Similarities in Computer Program and other Texts"
http://www.pam1.bcs.uwa.edu.au/~michaelw/ftp/doc/yap3.ps

For execution, the GreedyStringTiling.java has the main method, therefore 
just execute the GreedyStringTiling class found in com.nlputil.gst package.
You will know what you want to do to integrate this with your code as you scan
through the main method.
